GENESIS1.3 is a three-dimensional high gain free-electron laser code
developed by Sven Reiche (PSI). To process the data output, a suite of IDL
tools dubbed 'XGenesis' is available. To make this compatible with the
RadTrack framework, we have ported this functionality to Python.

GENESIS1.3 has a time-independent and a time-dependent FEL simulation. The
time-independent simulation assumes a static, coasting beam; the
time-dependent includes finite length bunch effects. RadTrack is able to
support both of these capabilities, and the post-processing depends on which
 simulation is done.

Time-independent simulations have only one 'independent' variable, the z
along the FEL. Thus, all plots are simple two-dimensional plots.

To generate a plot, select the two variables you wish to plot (the x-axis
defaults to the z coordinate, but this can be changed) and click the "Plot"
button to generate a Python plot of the data.

For simulations of full FEL dynamics, it is necessary to decide on the
independent variable, and compare with a slider the other independent
variable. Thus, the x-axis is either the distance along the undulator, z, or
the distance along the bunch, s. To generate the plots, a spline
interpolation is done between the discrete z and s variables GENESIS simulates.
